## Background and Tech Stack
##### Background 
Issue degrees, diplomas, certificates of participation or other credentials to your learners. Any school, college, university or training provider in Europe may use this tool to issue credentials for free and secure them with their e-seal. Credentials can be e-mailed to learners or directly deposited to their Europass profiles.
#### Tech stack
##### Front-end
Angular 7.x (eUI v7.4.1 - EUI Framework)
##### Back-end
Java 8, 
Spring,
JAXB, 
JPA
CEF DSS â€“ java library to create/validate e-signature (XAdES, PAdES, etc.)
#### Developed with:
Although it is possible to change the configuration to work with any OS, application server and database,
 the most tested configuration, the one explained in this document and the one used during development is the following:
##### Application Server
Apache Tomcat 9.0
##### Database
Oracle 12c
##### Operating System
linux RedHat
## Project structure
The issuer application is divided into 8 modules that can also be split in 2 groups, those that are necessary for the app functionality,
 and extra modules that are not required but provide extra functionality.
### Dependency common projects
The next two projects are shared across by multiple of the EDCI applications and are declared as a maven dependency. As a result, these two projects must be downloaded and compiled (or uploaded to a repository) prior to the EDCI Issuer project for the dependencies to be available. 
##### edci-commons
This project contains both utility and service classes that can be used by all of the other projects, as well as the main DataModel classes.
Also, common functionalities (such as security or DataModel services) are found in this project.
##### edci-dss-utils 
This module has functions used for the sealing and validation of the signatures of the credentials using the DSS library.
Any change required to the configuration of the DSS module will need to be included in this project.
### Required Modules
##### edci-issuer-common
This module contains classes used by all the other modules, mostly Constants and DTOs that are used across the application.
##### edci-issuer-persistence
this module contains the persistence layer of the application with it's DAOs and Repositories, all of the database related methods and queries reside here.
##### edci-issuer-service
This module contains most of the business logic, therefore most of the back-end core functions of the app reside here.
##### edci-issuer-web
This module contains the angular folder with the front-end code of the application, and the index.jsp from which is served.
Also, here reside all of the configuration files, as well as external or downloadable resources.
It also contains all the configuration properties into the resource folder:
* issuer - General configurations, such as datasources, url paths, remote endpoints...
* dss - Sealing configurations
* mail - SMTP Server properties and related configurations
* proxy - Proxy configurations
* security - Session and OIDC configurations

As the swagger codegen maven plugin resides in this module, compilation of this project will result in the typescript swagger files being recreated. 
##### edci-issuer-web-rest
This module contains all of the Rest API endpoints used by the frontend angular components, thus all of the operations externally available reside here.
Also, the swagger.json file is generated based on the annotations in this module, and during it's compilation time. 
##### edci-issuer-web-rest-swagger
This module contains all necessary files for swagger typescript generation, including mustache templates and custom Code Generators.
### Extra Modules
##### edci-issuer-web-swagger-ui
This module provies an automatic system of API documentation, it will take the swagger.json generated and copy it into this project, which will produce an artifact with the API documentation that can be deployed. 
##### edci-issuer-ear
This module is only responsible of packaging all of the modules into an ear file for deployment, thus no code resides here.
## Configuration
The EDCI issuer needs to be configured for the particular environment where is going to be deployed, this includes both technical configuration (such as database, mail server...) as well as custom app configurations (QSeal enforce, OIDC security...) 
All of the configuration is stored in files inside the projects and it consists of value/key pairs. Some of it is included in the artifact at compilation time, and some of it is read from the filesystem by the application.
Because of this, the configuration to be used must be decided and set prior to compiling the project. 
##### Profiles
The project can be configured and compiled with a variety of profiles, which can be used to provide a set of configurations for multiple environments.
The profile that is being used is specified at compilation time for both front-end and back-end, and must be the same for both compilation steps.
The current supported profiles are:
* default: this is the default profile used for development, which is the same as local-tomcat.
* local-tomcat: profile used for local development, the artifact can be deployed in a local tomcat 9+ environment.
* qa-tomcat: this profile is used for a QA environment, mostly for integration testing.
* acceptance: used mostly for UAT tests in a controlled environment.
* production: the profile used for live environment.

##### Profiles
The project can be configured and compiled with a variety of profiles, which can be used to provide a set of configurations for multiple environments.
The profile that is being used is specified at compilation time for both front-end and back-end, and must be the same for both compilation steps.
The current supported profiles are:

* local-tomcat: profile used for local development, the artifact can be deployed in a local tomcat 9+ environment.
* qa-tomcat: this profile is used for a QA environment, mostly for integration testing.
* acceptance: used mostly for UAT tests in a controlled environment.
* production: the profile used for live environment.

##### Compile-time configuration files 
Some of the properties that reside in the project, are used in XML files that are included in the artifact are compile time. 
Because of this, changing any of these properties requires a recompilation of the project.

The backend files containing properties that can only be changed in compile time  reside in the edci-issuer-web module, inside the config folder, here you will find the following folders containing configuration:
* cache: contains ehcache.xml file.
* issuer: contains basic properties for all the profiles.

Also, you will find an ext folder with an example of the files required as run-time configuration properties.

For front-end properties, all of the configurations can be found under the /environments folder, with environment.[profile].ts naming. 
##### Run-time configuration files
A good portion of the properties reside outside of the project, by default, the application expects to found this files in the file:${catalina.base}/conf/edci/issuer/ folder.
This path can be changed at the EDCIIssuerConfig class. The expected files are:
* issuer.properties
* issuer_dss.properties
* mail.properties
* proxy.properties
* security.properties
* issuer_front.properties
* users.properties 
 
These properties can be changed without recompiling the EDCI Issuer, but keep in mind that the application server must be restarted for the changes to take place.

## Build and deployment 
#### Requirements:
##### Compilation requirements
In order to compile the EDCI Issuer you will need
* Maven

If you are trying to deploy the EDCI Issuer project in a tomcat application server, you can check our [tomcat configuration](../configuration/documentation/tomcatConfiguration.md) page.
#### Building process:
#### Swagger file generation
The Project structure requires that swagger frontend files are generated before compiling the backend. This allows for the frontend api-related code to be autogenerated in an automatized way every time that back end is compiled.

To do so, a maven plugin in edci-issuer-web-rest-swagger module (com.github.kongchen.swagger-maven-plugin) will generate a swagger.json file based on the annotated endpoints in the edci-issuer-web-rest module.

After that, the module edci-issuer-web will generate the swagger frontend files, using once again a maven plugin (io.swagger.swagger-codegen-maven-plugin). Keep in mind that this requires the previous creation of an empty "dist" directory in edci-issuer-web/src/main/angular/dist.
 
This process is only required to do once if no changes in the code are applied. If the edci-issuer-web-rest endpoints where to be changed, then this generation has to be done again before the frontend code for api calls is available.
Because of this, the best way of doing a first generation of the swagger files, is to simply create an empty "dist" folder in the specified path, and then run a backend compilation, even if it means that it has to be compiled again after the front-end code has also been compiled.

#### External dependencies intallation
The EDCI Issuer makes uses of external libraries that are not available in public repositories. Because of this, external dependencies are included at /edci/configuration/external-libs folder.
Before building the EDCI Issuer, these dependencies must be installed into the local maven repository, this can easily be done by executing the following commands:
 
 * mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=eu.europa.ec.digit.uxatec.eui -DartifactId=eui-angular2-servlet -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=1.0.0 -Dfile=configuration/external-libs/eui-angular2-servlet-1.0.0.jar

##### Angular
The front-end application residing in edci-issuer-web must be compiled prior to the backend, to do so, just use the standard npm install command to update your node_modules directory, and after that use npm run build-[profile] scripts. Configuration for these scripts can be found in package.json file.
Keep in mind that any change to the API that would change swagger definition, requires a previous compilation of the back-end code.
``` 
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build-[profile]
```
##### Maven
This project uses maven to manage the projects build. Keep in mind that some of the edci-dss-utils project artifacts must be downloaded from specific respositories, [Here](../configuration/documentation/mvn_settings.xml) is an example of a basic maven configuration that can be used as a template (keep in mind that some values must be changed). 
Once the maven settings are ready, just execute the usual maven command using parent pom.xml with the desired profile, if no one is selected, default is used.
``` 
mvn clean install -P [profile]
```
##Core functions
This section describes the core functions of the issuer app, which allow the application to process, seal and issue credentials.
Some of this functions can be done only in one way, other may have multiple options.

### Upload XML
This functionality allows to upload muliple credentials or a verifiable presentations in XML format sample of the uploading format with wrapper can be found [here](../configuration/documentation/issuerXmlUpload.md).
The specific datamodel format for credentials can be found [here](https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model).

A more in-depth guide on how to upload a verifiable presentation instead of an credential can be found [here](../configuration/documentation/issuerBuildVP.md) 

### Upoload XLS
This functionality allows to upload multiple credentials through downloadable XLS templates that reside within the project. You can also find an example template [here](../configuration/documentation/issuerMacroEnabledExcel.md)

### Credential Builder
This functionality allows to define credential templates through a user interface, which then can be saved into a database. A user may select one of the owned credentials, and send it to any number of recipients. 

##### Credential Templates
The Credential templates represent the specifications of a particular credentials, without any personal information. This templates contain all of the information regarding the achievements, organisations, environments... that are shared between multiple credentials, which allows mass issuing of one credential.

##### Recipients
A recipient is the subject to which the credential will be issued. After selecting a credential to issue, you will be able to select multiple recipients for the credential. This can be done by either entering them manually on the application itelf, or by downloading an auto-generated excel, which you will need to fill and upload for the recipients to be processed. 
 
### Processing
During processing phase, validations take place. Mandatory fields are defined at the [europass data model](https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model).
Also, during processing time assets that may need to be downloaded, like multimedia assets or controlled lists items (check external dependencies section).
After the processing, XML files are created inside the configured temporal folder.
### Sealing
During sealing process, the credentials are sealed following configuration properties, after that, the credentials are validated against an Schema, which is also defined at the configuration properties.

There are different processes that can be used to perform the credential sealing, "nexu sealing" and "local sealing" are mutually exclusive and only one can be configured at the same time, meaning that changing from a configuration to another requires a reboot.

The configuration of the sealing process is done through the  "issuer_front.properties", changing the "enabledLocalSealing" property to "true" or "false".
Also, a TSP(TimeStamp Provider) URL must be configured in the "issuer.properties". As well as a signature level (see XadES Profiles at https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/doc/dss-documentation.html). Lastly, if the property "allow.qseals.only" is set to true, only eSeals will be allowed (no eSignatures).

#### Nexu sealing
This is the most common process for sealing and the default one. When this is active, the sealing process in the frontend will redirect the user to nexu app (which must be previously installed, see: https://nowina.lu/solutions/java-less-browser-signing-nexu/) to select the certificate.

After selecting the certificate from nexu, the sealing process will continue.

Keep in mind, that this process is mutually exclusive with local sealing, meaning that only one of the systems can be configured as active in any given time.

To configure the nexu sealing, the "enabledLocalSealing" at the "issuer_front.properties" file, must be set to "true".
#### Local Sealing
If local sealing is enabled, the credentials will be sealed using the configured local certificate during the normal sealing process through the front-end application. The user will be required to introduce the password in the frontend, and will be used in server with the stored cert in order to sign the credentials.

To configure the local sealing, the "enabledLocalSealing" at the "issuer_front.properties" file, must be set to "false". But also a certificate (ie: a .pfx file) is required to exist in the server, and the path to the certificate must be specified in the "dss.cert.path" of the "issuer.properties" configuration file. 

### API Sealing
Api sealing is a form of Local Sealing (using existing certificate in the server) meant to be used by using api calls to three specific endpoints:

* /api/v1/public/credentials/seal : seals a credential and returns it as a download.
* /api/v1/public/credentials/seal_and_send : seals a credential and sens it to the specified wallet, returns a viewer link.
* /api/v1/public/credentials/seal_batch : seals a batch of credentials and sends it to the specified wallet, returns 202 if all credentials have valid format.

As with the local sealing, a certificate (ie: a .pfx file) is required to exist in the server, and the path to the certificate must be specified in the "dss.cert.path" of the "issuer.properties" configuration file. 
Furthermore, this endpoints have a basic auth security, meaning that a "user.properties" file must exist on the server with [username=password,ROLE,enabled] where the password must be stored in a bcrypt hash.
### Issuing
Issuing can be done in two ways, wallet uploading and email attachments.
* Wallet Upload : The EDCI Issuer will try to uplad the file to the property configured wallet.
* Email attachment : The EDCI Issuer will try to send an email with the credential attached, based on the email field of the credential itself.

If one of the the methods fails, a message is shown.
## External dependencies
The EDCI Issuer project has external dependencies which are mandatory, and must be supplied in one way or another, otherwise core functions will be unusable. This means that the EDCI issuer requires 
#### Controlled Lists
The EDCI Issuer makes use of the European Publications Office controlled lists, some of these are mandatory to use for some of the Code fields of the datamodel, you can expand on both of this matters in the [datamodel page]() and the [controlled lists page]() of this document.
#### ESCO Skills and Occupation
The EDCI Issuer makes user of values in the ESCO Framework, to fill the values of certain Code fields. This information is queried through the ESCO Skill API, which must contain the information for the Code field to be correctly processed. 

You can find more about the ESCO Framework utilization in EDCI [here](../configuration/documentation/escoFramework.md) 
#### Timestap Provider
At the issuer_dss_[profile].properties file in the back-end server, it is mandatory to provide a valid TimeStamp provider in the form of URL. 

#### OIDC Identity Provider
Although a mock user can be enabled por testing purposes, an OIDC Identity provider will be required for the credential builder to work properly. All of the required configurations for this can be found in the security_[profile].properties file.
All fo this is implemented using the Authentication (Basic) flow. For implementations, spring-security and [mitreId](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/) are used. If you want to know more about it, an in-depth explanation on the current configuration can be found [here](https://steps.everis.com/confluence/display/EDCI/EuLogin+OIDC+integration).
#### Mail Server
In order to send the attached credential through email, this must be configured. It is required that the email session is defined in the application server configuration as explained in the Configuration section of this document.

All of the extra configurations for this can be found in the mail_[profile].properties file.
