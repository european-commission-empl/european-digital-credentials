# Macro-Enabled Excel
The EDC Excel template, suitable for preparing larger credential datasets, is downloadable from the EDCI Issuer page.

On the first sheet of the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook you will find some basic written instructions about how to use the table to enter your credential data. Before you start working with the Excel table, make sure that you can edit the content and macros are enabled.

##Macro enabled
There are 8 clearly distinguished sheets to support you in recording your credential data in a systematic manner. All sheets have a "Default Value" row, where you can enter data in the yellow cells. These will be automatically copied into each new row you add to speed up the data filling procedure.

##Default view
Some of these field contents come from a controlled list, and some may even have multiple values, such as an activityâ€™s language of instruction. Use the drop-down menu to select and deselect all applicable choices.
